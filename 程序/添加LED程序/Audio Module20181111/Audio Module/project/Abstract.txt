The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the
GigaDevice 'GD32F32150C8' microcontroller using 'GD321x0C-START' evaluation board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =     8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =    72.00 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode.
 - if Button 'User Key' is pressed all LEDs are lit.



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  GD32F150C8 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                       (used for production or target debugging)

  GD32F150C8 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                       (used for target debugging)
